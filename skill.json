You won't find any movie audio clips here. Obviously, results vary from quote to quote; some are amazingly accurate and will sync perfectly with the actual quote, while others are humorously bad. Definitely not the most ground-breakings skill available on Alexa, but it is a fun example of what can be done with her speech using various Amazon services.\\n HOW TO USE\\n Simply just say, 'Alexa, open AFI quotes', after the short introduction just ask Alexa to 'get a quote'. At anytime you can ask for help by saying, 'help' or have Alexa repeat the last quote by saying, 'repeat' or 'say again'."
